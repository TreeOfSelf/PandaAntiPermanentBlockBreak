# PandaAntiPermanentBlockBreak

## Description

This mod makes it so that breaking bedrock & end-portal frames is impossible. This also fixes breaking blocks with growing mushrooms, as well as fixing breaking blocks with piston glitching. A configuration file will be made if requested.

## Configuring

`config/PandaAntiPermanentBlockBreak.json` generated at runtime
```json
{
  "strictBreakCheck": false // if set to true, it will be impossible with commands, creative, or any method to break bedrock/end portal frames. EXCEPT for the bedrock that breaks when spawning the end dragon. This is a safe-guard as new methods can be discovered, and mixins can silently break over updates.
}
```

## Try it out
