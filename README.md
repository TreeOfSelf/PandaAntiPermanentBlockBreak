# PandaAntiPermanentBlockBreak

## Description

This mod makes it so that breaking bedrock & end-portal frames is impossible. This also fixes breaking blocks with growing mushrooms, as well as fixing breaking blocks with piston glitching. A configuration file will be made if requested.

## Try it out
`hardcoreanarchy.gay`   (Deathban Anarchy)  
`sky.hardcoreanarchy.gay`   (Skyblock Anarchy)
